A productivity app that automatically schedules and tracks skill progression. The app builds the training/learning schedule around the users existing schedules, and optimizes deliberate practice using spacing, interleaving and variation techniques. The focus is to step away from "streak" based rewards, as this tends to create a mentality of fear from losing a streak. We alleviate this fear by creating an openness to "procrastination within reason", and tracking the users feelings about their progress from day to day. Our philosophy also pulls from the "10,000 hours" theory and the pomodoro technique. MOBILE - location based notifications (i see you're back at home -> youve set aside a block for guitar, would you like to start?) SOCIAL - shareable skill trees, check-ins and validate teammates hours INTERACTIVE - drag time blocks around the calendar, data visualization with attitudes/productivity over time, and skill tree building

Philosophy
pomodoro / 10000 hours / space, interleaved, varied practice
Procrastination is OK, how user feels about progress in time spent
3 x optimal deliberate practices 
Space practice - single day vs. Split over 1 week having much higher success rate
Interleaved practice
Varied practice -> skills in different ways. (Mix it up)
Minimal structure necessary for progress - high intensity scheduling can be intimidating

Start - look at learning apps. Take note of skill trees, intro pages, reminders, suggestion notes , active tutorials

Open ended time focused vs. Goal oriented

Exercise updates and connects to health kit

Time “blocks” -> “ tap and go” within available time block

  Importance: (A=high, B=medium, C=low)
  Urgency: (1=high, 2=medium, 3=low)

	80/20 rule

	Delete it / Delegate it / Do it / Defer it

	Eat the Frog

	Reduce the number of meetings

	Jar of Rocks, pebbles, sand and water

	Batch your time wasters

A dream of mastery starts with specific goals, which broken down into steps becomes a plan. The plan is then backed by deliberate effort and individual actions.
